# TrayMagic
A custom tray icon to run commands and stuff

## Vision

Add a lightweight way to to run often-run commands via a tray icon (to integrate with minimal DEs like i3).
Maybe some more advanced stuff like toggles etc. later on.

## State

Right now this is mostly me getting my feet wet with Zig.
This won't be a production-quality tool for the near future, maybe ever.
The scope of the project, the amount of user-configurability, etc. are still up for exploration.
